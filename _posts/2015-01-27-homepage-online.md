## The new homepage is now online

Markus Huber will now be fully responsible for the whole C# lecture. In order to simplify the organization everything has been transferred to GitHub, where all material will be available in form of repositories. The homepage itself is also hosted on GitHub, with Jekyll as the blog engine.
