Here are additional resources too keep learning or to use as reference.

## [.NET documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/dotnet/)
Microsofts .NET documentation not only for C#. Good for reference and further learning.

## [Game Programming Patterns](http://www.gameprogrammingpatterns.com/)
A collection about useful programming patterns often used in games. Examples are in C++, but are easy to adapt.

## [Tasks and Parallelism: The New Wave of Multithreading](https://www.codemag.com/article/1211071/Tasks-and-Parallelism-The-New-Wave-of-Multithreading)
A good article by Miguel Castro about Tasks and Parallelism. As this can be a confusing topic this article is highly recommended.

## [C# 7.0 Pocket Reference](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920084211.do)
A very handy and complete reference for C# by Ben Albahari and Joseph Albahari.
